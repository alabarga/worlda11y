#RAM-Datapipeline

This is based on the [ram datapipeline](https://github.com/WorldBank-Transport/ram-datapipeline/tree/develop/ram-analysis/app/utils)
 which is based on my initial rural road accessibility application (RRA) so we go full circle.

 The main reason for the fork is that RAM, just like RRA is way more configurable and allows for custom networks etc. We don't want that :)
 It also stores all kinds of data and configuration in a database - which generally is good - but in our case a bit too much overhead
